        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Informatics and Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, from The British University in Egypt and London South Bank University. Experienced in data management, processing, and analysis with a focus on optimizing pipelines and enhancing data quality. Proficient in Apache Spark, SQL, and NoSQL. Committed to continuous learning and collaboration across teams.</p>
        <p>During my tenure as a Front End Web Developer Trainee at ITICS, I gained hands-on experience in crafting tailored solutions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. This opportunity honed my skills in front-end development and provided valuable insights into practical web technologies.</p>
        <p>As a Data Science & AI Intern at SYNC Interns, I had the privilege of applying theoretical knowledge to real-world projects, under the mentorship of Naveen Kumar and the SYNC Interns Team. This experience fortified my skills in data science and AI, preparing me for future endeavors.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, my roles as a Machine Learning Intern at both Mentorness and TechnoHacks EduTech provided dynamic experiences involving hands-on projects and real-world applications. These internships deepened my understanding of machine learning and data analysis, enhancing my ability to tackle complex problems.</p>
        <p>My involvement in various projects, such as Anomaly Detection in a Cavitational Desalination Pump and Sentiment Analysis Model for Women's Clothes E-commerce Reviews, demonstrates my capability to conduct research and develop practical solutions using advanced techniques.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I have showcased my creativity and technical prowess through game development projects like "The Code of Treasures" and "The Life of a Miner in Congo," as well as contributions to software quality assurance initiatives.</p>
        <p>I am eager to leverage my diverse experiences and skills in a dynamic environment, contributing to innovative projects and driving impactful decisions.</p>
